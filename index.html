  <h2>About Kamgaar</h2>

  <!-- PART 1: WHO WE ARE -->
  <div class="about-block">
    <h3>Who We Are</h3>
    <p>
      Kamgaar is a workforce management company built exclusively for
      heavy-equipment operators. We employ operators full-time, manage them
      end-to-end, and deploy them to critical infrastructure, construction,
      industrial, and mining projects across India.
    </p>

    <p>
      Heavy equipment cannot afford downtime — and neither can the businesses
      that rely on it. Kamgaar exists to eliminate manpower uncertainty from
      mission-critical operations.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- PART 2: WHAT WE DO -->
  <div class="about-block">
    <h3>What We Do</h3>

    <p><strong>We Employ Operators Full-Time</strong></p>
    <p>
      All operators on Kamgaar are hired as permanent employees. They receive
      fixed salaries, formal employment contracts, PF, insurance, and statutory
      benefits — creating stability, accountability, and long-term commitment.
    </p>

    <p><strong>We Deploy Operators to Client Sites</strong></p>
    <p>
      Our operators are deployed to EPCs, contractors, and equipment rental
      companies based on the right skill, right machine, and right site
      requirements. Clients get ready-to-work operators without the burden of
      hiring, payroll, or compliance.
    </p>

    <p><strong>We Guarantee Workforce Continuity</strong></p>
    <p>
      We provide SLA-backed replacements to ensure zero downtime for critical
      equipment. If an operator is unavailable, Kamgaar manages rapid
      replacement — so operations never stop.
    </p>

    <p><strong>We Manage the Entire Workforce Lifecycle</strong></p>
    <p>
      From recruitment and verification to payroll, compliance, attendance,
      performance, and safety oversight — Kamgaar manages everything under one
      accountable employer model.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- PART 3: WHO WE WORK WITH -->
